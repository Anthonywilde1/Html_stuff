            <h3>Devil May Cry</h3>
            <p>My top game of all time would have to be Devil May Cry, not for its story and lets not even talk about DMC2..., but mechanically the game is amazing!, high intensity Japanese power metal while you character styles on Demon enemies, its great to play but requires some time to master, most people would bounce off a game this complex when the normal mode is beaten and thats fine, DMC is a work of art and how mastery of a system can look so good. Not to mention the cast for the voice acting is amazing. If you are a fan or character action one of the 4 - 5 or 6? (I lost count) characters you can play as will surely fit your playstyle.</p>

                <h3>Doom: Eternal</h3>
                <p>Doom Eternal and Doom 2016 showed that there is still a place for an old school shooter in today's market, Doom Eternal is fantastic in how over the top the game is in its sheer violence. It also plays extremely well, feels smooth and fun; using glory kills, the chainsaw, shooting rockets, the BFG! and the crucible aswell as many other weapons will leave you with a heightened heart beat and a taste for vengence. RIP AND TEAR</p>

            <h3>Kingdom Hearts</h3>
            <p>The Kingdom Hearts series will always have a special place in my heart, however the game is far from perfect in its current state, it throws back to a nostalgia of old, playing the first Kingdom Hearts around 8-12? Going on an adventure with Donald and Goofy to find your friends and Mickey Mouse, meeting Final Fantasy Characters along the way. Great Fun! The story got way to convulted for its own good by the end though leaving people completing KH3 being like what the fuck just happened?</p>

            <h3>Bioshock Series</h3>
            <p>I always found Bioshock to be an amazing game, something about the theming behind it was what pulled me in the most, this idea that a city could function at the bottom of the sea and that ethics were different down there, leading to a complete collapse of Capitalism when the people in control start to lose their grip on the free market. All centered around the idea of "Adam" a mcguffin that allows one to change the their own DNA/genome. To start shooting lightning from your fingers, be super swole, freeze people. If you don't like the underwater vibe the 3rd game exists in a sky city!</p>

            <h3>Power Rangers: Battle For The Grid</h3>
            <p>If you want a silly fighting game that is kind of janky then Power Rangers is your game, I think Power Rangers is a great franchise I enjoy it for its over the top pyrotechnics, this game is fairly fast paced for a fighting game and I like that, my experience with other more complex fighting games is they have a steeper learning curve that makes it less fun for everyone, Power Rangers keeps it simple which is what a fighting game needs to be really.</p>
